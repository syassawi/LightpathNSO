Installation of NSO

Cisco NSO can run on macOS or on Linux systems. If you are a Window's user (or if you don't wish to install it natively on your laptop), you can install NSO on a Linux virtual machine or in a container.

Prereqs:

Java
NSO requires Java to be installed to function. Here are some common ways to install Java:

macOS
Homebrew - brew cask install java
Java.com
Linux
With apt - apt install default-jdk
With yum - yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

Apache Ant
Apache Ant is a Java library and tool for building files and other dependencies that you will also need.

macOS
Homebrew - brew install ant
Linux
With apt - apt install ant
With yum - yum install ant

Development tools
You may need to install a few additional tools for development. In particular xml processing tools are helpful:

macOS
Homebrew - brew install libxml2
Linux
With apt - apt install libxml2-utils
With yum - yum install libxml2

Local vs System Installation
Before you install NSO onto your system, you need to decide whether to do a "System" or "Local" installation. Here's a simple breakdown of the two.

System Install is used when installing NSO for a centralized, "always-on", production grade purpose. It is configured as a system daemon that would start and end with the underlying operating system. The default users of admin and oper are not included and the file structure is more distributed.
Local Install is used for development, lab, and evaluation purposes. It unpacks all the application components, including docs and examples, and can be used by the engineer to run multiple, unrelated, instances of NSO for different labs and demos on a single workstation .

We will be preforming a Local Instalation for the POC purpose.

Performing a Local Installation
Once you've installed the pre-reqs and downloaded the NSO installation file for your operating system, you are ready to do your installation.

1. Open up a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the installer.
Make sure you have the correct installer binary for your OS, darwin is for macOS and linux is for everything else.

BASH
Copycd ~/Downloads
ls -l nso*.bin
-rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff   199M Dec 15 11:45 nso-5.3.darwin.x86_64.installer.bin
-rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff   199M Dec 15 11:45 nso-5.3.darwin.x86_64.signed.bin
If your file is a signed.bin file, this means that the file you downloaded has been digitally signed by Cisco, and when you execute it you'll verify the signature and unpack the installer.bin. If you have the installer.bin skip down past the signed steps.

2. Use the sh command to "run" the signed.bin to verify the certificate and extract the installer binary and other files.

BASH
Copy sh nso-5.3.darwin.x86_64.signed.bin

3. If it all comes back green, you're in good shape and ready to install. Here is what was unpacked.

BASH
Copy ls -l

4. First, checkout the --help on the installer binary using the sh nso-5.3.darwin.x86_64.installer.bin --help command. Notice the two options for --local-install or --system-install

BASH
Copy sh nso-5.3.darwin.x86_64.installer.bin --help

 # Output
 This is the NCS installation script.

 Usage: ./nso-5.3.darwin.x86_64.installer.bin [--local-install] LocalInstallDir

 Installs NCS in the LocalInstallDir directory only.
 This is convenient for test and development purposes.

 Usage: ./nso-5.3.darwin.x86_64.installer.bin --system-install [--install-dir InstallDir]
     [--config-dir ConfigDir] [--run-dir RunDir] [--log-dir LogDir]
     [--run-as-user User] [--keep-ncs-setup] [--non-interactive]

 Does a system install of NCS, suitable for deployment.
 Static files are installed in InstallDir/ncs-<vsn>.
 The first time --system-install is used, the ConfigDir,
 RunDir, and LogDir directories are also created and
 populated for config files, run-time state files, and log files,
 respectively, and an init script for start of NCS at system boot
 and user profile scripts are installed. Defaults are:

 InstallDir - /opt/ncs
 ConfigDir  - /etc/ncs
 RunDir     - /var/opt/ncs
 LogDir     - /var/log/ncs

 By default, the system install will run NCS as the root user.
 If the --run-as-user option is given, the system install will
 instead run NCS as the given user. The user will be created if
 it does not already exist.

 If the --non-interactive option is given, the installer will
 proceed with potentially disruptive changes (e.g. modifying or
 removing existing files) without asking for confirmation.
 
5.For the installation directory or LocalInstallDir, the recommendation is to install it into your $HOME directory into a folder called ~/nso-VERSION. So if our version is 5.3, our directory will be ~/nso-5.3.

6. Run the installer with the argument --local-install ~/nso-5.3 to install it into your home directory

BASH
Copy sh nso-5.3.darwin.x86_64.installer.bin --local-install ~/nso-5.3

 # Output

7. That's it, you're installed.
